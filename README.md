As tumors are highly heterogeneous and vary from patient to patient, molecular subtyping of tumors facilitates the accurate diagnosis and treatment of cancer. 


This repository demonstrates the quantification of the activity of 28 immune cells in each patient using the GSVA algorithm and the identification of immune subtypes 
of cancer using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. In addition, a significance test for comparing immune activity 
between subtypes is shown. 


In particular, note that each sample data used here is a random selection of 100 samples from the original sample, given the limitations of 
the github upload file size.
